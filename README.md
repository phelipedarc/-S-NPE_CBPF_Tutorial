# Simulation-Based Inference: <font color="#FF7F50">Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE)</font> Tutorial
This repository contains a tutorial notebook demonstrating the implementation of Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), a powerful method in simulation-based inference. 


NPE can be employed in two primary configurations:

- Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE)

- Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation (ANPE)

## Usage:

Explore the world of simulation-based inference, also known as likelihood-free inference (LFI) or SBI, through this Jupyter notebook. Gain insights into the Neural Posterior Estimation method and its applications.

### Installation
To use this notebook, please ensure that you have the following libraries installed:
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- SBI
- kilonovanet [Simulator]

To install the SBI package, visit https://www.mackelab.org/sbi/

Refer to the last cell of the notebook for essential functions and libraries.
